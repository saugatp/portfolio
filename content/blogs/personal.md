Something I've always struggled from early days of my life is building up *habits* and *discipline*. I value **discipline** the most as something crucial, yet I'm the one struggling to follow it. For some, self help books like __"Atomic habits"__ have helped, however I've become so arrogant and immune, it's hard for me to follow those books. I've always been an overthinker and wanderer, but overthinking something so much, that I got exhausted before I start the task I was thinking about has been my most successful defense mechanism.  
### Why this blog?
This blog is more personal than professional, and about something I want to change. Up until my dissertation, I am going to continuously work on the following things to grow myself:
- This ***blog,*** which I will update atleast twice a week.
- `Leetcode` and coding competitions, which I am going to do atleast 3 days a week and atleast 2 hours each day.
- __Running__ once a day, for more than 30 min, missed a day, 1 hrs next day and so on.
- Work on my projects __`Geet`__ and __`Apps Uninstaller`__, atleast 3 times a week and 1 hours for each apps each day.
- My __dissertation__, which I have to update my supervisor each week.

### My projects
__`Geet`__ is my own personal music player app, that I am creating for the sole purpose of updating myself on android and things I missed after leaving my job 2 years ago. I am also building a backend at the same time leveraging ExpressJs to be able to stream my own music catalogue. 
__`App Uninstaller`__ on the other hand is something I have done previously, but wanted to do better because I see the niche this app can succed in. I want to build this app better and faster and correctly. The main purpose of this app is uninstalling multiple apps at once, however features will be added gradually.
