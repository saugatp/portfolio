I am using Obsidian starting recently for taking notes and saving my thoughts. But, I hadn't explored more into the available plugins and community support of this awesome tool. 
### Why obsidian
Firstly, because it's pretty great and secondly **Git Support**. Yes, this is a game changer for me, as I do take my journals in obsidian saving in local folder and I was also trying to make a journaling app for myself that saves and shows my journal on my site. However this became pretty complex once I found that hugo doesn't support dynamic updates. 
### My plan
My plan for this setup is installing obsidian on all my devices and giving them access to my **github repo**. From there, I can make changes and write blogs, as well as update journals whenever I need. As journal updates will run a full build, I need to make them sync once every 2 hours or more, sometimes once a day even. 
### Setbacks this week
Although on my previous [blog](long-time.md), I had made and set some goals for my habit and discipline. However, all of that has not been fulfilled by myself because of my personal circumstances and health. Past week was something of a slow one, which I am trying to improve from today. I am still a bit *under the weather*, but getting better.

As today is the last extra day of February, I am still searching for a job. This year has been a huge setback for me and there has been still, no changes. Thank you for reading. See you.
