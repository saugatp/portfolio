summary: First time writing my own blogs and my personal journey
---

Although it was my long term dream to write blogs, my hesitation of signing into a new environment had kept me from doing it. But now, after researching a bit on self hosting blog sites, I got into static site generators, eventually leading me to choose Hugo for my chosen platform. **Markdown** has always been my weak point, although I wanted to learn it, I never got a chance. But ***this*** blogging project, I have taken as my challenge both on learning markdown as well as blogging atleast 3-4 times a week about what I am learning. So with all these explained, _Hello World ?_

### About me
I am a software developer, although *All-in-one* kind, but I have primarily been working on mobile platform since 6 years, both **Android** as well as **Flutter** for multiplatform. 

I began my journey as an android developer in [**Amakomaya**](https://amakomaya.com/about-us/) after I graduated in June 2016, and have since been moving around, trying things here and there. After 2022, however I began studying full time in [**Northumbria University**](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk), as a Computing student, beginning my learning phase once again. As I moved countries, ahead of me is a clean slate from which I can start over my career once again, if I find something that I feel like doing.

### Now what?
I have got newfound interests in <mark> Data analysis and database systems </mark>, after our course **LD7080** which was about data analysis. With that in mind, I am currently learning more about the topic as well as starting to learn about ***data structures and algorithms*** to refresh my mind. Also with the dissertation coming soon, I also need to choose a proper research topic which I think should be related to the same topic as well. 
This website, including my all blogs will be related to programming and my research journey, new things I learned as well as things that I wanted to share. For anyone reading this, Welcome to my caravan! :pray: :uk:
