summary: Thinking of building my new tech blog
---
### Learning
I did not learn much today, although learned few tips and tricks and am thinking about making a site for my new tutorial page. I got little motivation from my own blog, as I feel like I can finally write and publish better blogs teaching flutter and android programming tips and tricks. 
I started one youtube channel back in 2020 about flutter, but abandoned after some time not being able to publish videos, and I doubt the same with any website I create too. However, with better hopes and better knowledge, I feel like I should do it now letting bygones be bygones. 
I also have to start working on my dissertation report writing from tomorrow. 
### Mood
Mood was pretty normal throughout the day, meeting with few peoples, I was able to uplift my downer mood a bit. I am hoping of my mood being a bit better for coming weeks.
